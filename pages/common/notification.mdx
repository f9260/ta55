You can follow the videos created using the notification feature via Telegram.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Activate Telegram Notifications

<Steps>
### Login to Telegram Account

Log in to your Telegram account via your desktop app or phone.

### Activating the BotFather Bot

Type BotFather in the search field and log in to the **"blue-ticked (approved)"** bot profile.


<Image src={bot1} />

After logging in to the bot account, press the **Start** button below on the screen that appears.

### Create a New Bot

After pressing the start button, run **/newbot**.

<Image src={bot3} />


### Entering Bot Information

Now we need a name for our bot and a username ending with **bot**.

Let's first name our bot and then define our username.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The **dot (.)** cannot be used when defining a username ending with bot.
</Callout>
     


<Image src={bot4} />


### Launch Your Bot

After entering the user information, information such as token and bot login link is sent to us by the bot.

In order to move on to the new steps, let's start the bot account sent to us by clicking on the bot link shown with **red arrow**.


<Image src={bot5} />


Our bot can now be activated. Let's activate our bot with the **Start** button.

<Image src={bot6} />


### Getting Token and Chat ID Information

After activating our bot, we can move on to the token processes.

We copy the token information given to us by clicking on it

<Image src={bot7} />


Let's paste it into the section that says < TOKEN > in the link below.


```ansi
https://api.telegram.org/bot< TOKEN >/getUpdates
```

After this process, we will have a url like this.

```ansi
https://api.telegram.org/bot7078338560:AAFaCK9F.....fKv1SK2Xf_qFzoLhSg1M/getUpdates
```

When you access the link, you will see such a page.

<Image src={bot8} />


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If only the " ok: true, result[] " text appears, trigger the bot by sending any text to your Telegram bot you created and then refresh the link page.
</Callout>


### Token and Chat ID Integration

We obtained our token information from the bot, now we can get the Chat ID from the link page above and integrate it into our system.

The values expressed with "**id:**" indicate our Chat ID.

In our example, our Chat ID is **`id:`6126....88**.

<Image src={bot9} />


Now we can integrate all this information into our VE3.Plus system.

- **Bot Token** : 7078338560:AAFaCK9F....fKv1SK2Xf_qFzoLhSg1M
- **Chat ID** : 6126....88

<Image src={bot10} />

**That's all...**


### Conclusion

Now, when you start your work, if the content production process is longer than 15 minutes, you will receive information about the progress every 15 minutes.

For example, you wanted to produce 100 videos with the **Boost** feature, and the 34th video is produced in the 15th minute.

The text "34th video is being processed..." reflected in the logs will also be displayed on your account as a notification from Telegram.

In this way, you will be able to easily follow the progress of your work when you are not in front of the computer.

Additional notification will be sent as soon as the work is completed.
