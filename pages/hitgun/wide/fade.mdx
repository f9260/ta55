# Fade

The Fade feature allows you to add a fading effect at the beginning and end of your videos.

For example, with a fade set to 3 seconds for the beginning, the video image starts out dark and brightens at 3 seconds.

If you set 3 seconds for the end of the video, the image will gradually fade to black 3 seconds before the end of the video.

## Fade Settings

Fade settings are made with the " - " symbol.

At least 2 values must be entered.

A value of 0 ensures that no operation is performed.

For example, if you want to set a fade of 4 seconds only for `start of video`;

**4-0**

value must be entered.

If you only want to add a 3 second fade setting to the `end of video`;

**0-3**

value must be entered.

If you want to set the fade both at the beginning and end of the video;

**4-3**

You can enter the desired values such as.



#### Intro/Outro Fade

Fade settings can also be applied for Intro and Outro. 

#### Intro Fade


When you want to set the fade for Intro only, the fade setting is applied to the end of your intro.

For example, if you want to set a fade of 3 seconds;

**4-3-3**

value is enough. So the value at the end determines your intro fade value.



#### Outro Fade


When you apply a fade setting for your outro, the fade is set to the beginning of the outro.

**4-3-3-4**

When you make a setting like this, the 4 at the end allows the fade feature to be applied to the first 4 seconds of your outro.


You should add a value of 0 to the moments you do not want to apply fade.

For example, if you want to set the fade for the outro only;


**0-0-0-4**

You must enter a value in the form.


**3-2-0-2**

fade setting is applied to the beginning and end of your video, but not to the intro. Then a 2-second fade setting is applied for Outro.
