## Synchronous

It was created for the Ti3 system. With the Ti3 system, it is possible to download videos from Tiktok while simultaneously 
the download folder is scanned and the detected content is edited.

If no new video is detected within 10 minutes, the system shuts down.

## Use-Delete

If activated, the content that has finished editing is deleted so that the content used does not take up more space on the computer.
